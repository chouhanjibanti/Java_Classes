Method Overloading :-
Constructor Overloading:- we can declare any number of constructor with
the same name/ same className but different different formal argument are known as Constructor Overloading. the purpose of Constructor Overloading to create same blueprint class object in different ways.
Example :- chair ,mobile 


Note :- out of n constructor in a class we can create [n-1] this() statement.


Note :- we can use void as well as return keyword for  same method but we don't want to return any value from that method.

Syntax :- 

public static void add(){
   return;
}



===========================================


1. OOPS :- 
2. Class and Object :- 
3. Constructor :- default , no argument , parameterized constructor
4. Constructor overloading :- 
5. Constructor Chaining :- this() and super()
6. StackOverFlow :- The non primitive variable of the class can be local variable in the same class and  the global  static variable in the same class but can not non static global variable in the same class we got problem that  
problem will occur during the runtime time is known as stackOverFlow Error.

Encapsulation
Polymorphism 
Inheritance 
Abstraction

Encapsulation:- 

1. The process of wrapping of properties or behaviour of an object within the single unit of class is known as encapsulation.
2.Example :- 

          -----> model , color , price [properties/variable/attributes]
         
Bike

        ------> riding [behavious/method]
        
        
* Advantage of the Encapsulation
1. Code Reusability
2. we can make properties as private and we can provide controlled access to the user by using the getter and setter methods.


Getter and Setter Methods:- 

1. Setter methods is a public methods that help the user to reinitlize the private properties.
2. Every setter method start with set Set .



1. Getter methods is also a public methods which help to user to read the private property from outside the class(another class)
2. Every getter method start with Get

3. The return type of getter method depends on the dataType of the private member.
