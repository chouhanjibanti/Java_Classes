// Real time Example of method overloading 

// we have overloaded print and println method within the PrintStream class
// that help us to perform same printing operation but receiveing diff actual argument.
// to access this non static methods we need the ref variable of the class that is acutally static variable 
//present within the SYstem class .


// Diff between static and non static member.
//1. static member have single Copy of memory block 
//1. Non state member have multiple copy of memory block.

// 2. We can access the static  member with the help of the class name .
// 2. So if you want to access the non static  member that time we use  object reference variable 

// 3. object creation is not required to access the static member.
// 3. object creation is required to access the non static member.

// 4.  we can not use the this keyword within static context.
// 4.  we can  use the this keyword within non static context.
