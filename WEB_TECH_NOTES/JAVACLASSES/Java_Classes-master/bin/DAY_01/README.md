===========================================


Programming Language :- instructions provides , specific tasks.

P L :- 
1. low level :- close to machine code [machine language]
2. High level :- human-friendly and easier to learn[JAVA , PYTHON]

Java :- P.L and it platform independent 
java high level
Object oriented p l 
simple 
secure programming language
java intro :- james ghosling ->  1991 -> oak -> java .
multithreaded 
Oops


we have two types of translators:- 
1. Compiler[performs translation knows as compilation]
2. Interpreter[performs translation knows as interpretation]

Compiler :- 
java file compiled by java compiler [javac] -> syntax 
converts the java code to into bytecode 
   simple.java          --->  simple.class

              compiler[javac] ByteCode
JAVA CODE ---------> 


Runtime/Interpreter :- 

class file -> classLoader -> ByteCode verified  -> Interpreter -> Runtime -> Display

c and c++
1. c structural Pro
2. c++ OOPs

1. 32 keywords
2. 52 Keywords

1. c does not support inheritance
2. c++ support
   
=========================================

Diff between  a++ and java 

1. c++  dependent
2. java inde

1. c++ con and des
2. java cons

1. c++ multiple inher
2. java poss in concept interface  , class concept not poss

diff between JDK and JRE and JVM


JDK :- java development kit 
jdk compresses of javac and java runtime environment , jre provides basic requirement JVM to perform execution and such as libraries etc.



How java is a platform independent language[Architecturally neutral language]
Translator :- 
1. Compilation :- the source file is translated into the classfile by javac only if the java program according to the syntax.

classfile generate :- computer not even by the machine [ILCODE]


2. Interpretation/Execution /Run :- the class file translated to the binary language by using the platform dependent application known as java virtual machine.
 JVM works specifically with a particular platform.


Structure of Java program :- 

public static void main(String[]args){
    // statement 
}
public :- access specifier 
static :- 
void :- return datatype 
main :- methodName 
statement :- 



single line comment :- //
multiline comment :- /* */


Tokens :- elements of java program.

classified in diff :-
1. identifier
2. keyword
3. Literals/data/values
4. seperators


keyword :- keyword predefined word who meaning can not be change.

Example :- public , static , void , private , class , default , byte , short , int , float , long , if , else , switch etc.



identifier :- this are the name provided by the developer to recognized diff members of java programs.such as methods , variables , interface , enum known as identifier.

a) rules  :- these are man according to the syntax.

 -> keyword can not use as a identifier.
 -> it should not be start with a number.
 -> we accept only two special characters $ and _.


b) convention :- there are the standard practice that we follow across the java industry for identifier.

-> java program name -> start with uppercase 
 multiple words -> HelloProgram

 -> Methods name :- demo() -> demoProgram()

 -> same name of the file name with the class name.
